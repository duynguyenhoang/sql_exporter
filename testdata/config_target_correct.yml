  #   (ii) slow queries are canceled early when the database is already under heavy load
  # Prometheus informs targets of its own scrape timeout (via the "X-Prometheus-Scrape-Timeout-Seconds" request header)
  # so the actual timeout is computed as:
  #   min(scrape_timeout, X-Prometheus-Scrape-Timeout-Seconds - scrape_timeout_offset)
  #
  # If scrape_timeout <= 0, no timeout is set unless Prometheus provides one. The default is 10s.
